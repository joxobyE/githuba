#### What is worthy?

In my opnion, this Hall of Fame is to showchase things that
Github enables or highlights. I'm generally looking for anything
that could be described as epic.

Pull requests, issues, and comments are great examples, since Github's UI
enables or highlights these interactions in otherwise boring source control.

Individual Commits also seem fine to me because really, Github is the reason
we have nice access to epic diffs.

It makes less sense to me to submit an entire project, because the
project could exist anywhere.

These are somewhat loose guidelines. As more precedents are set, they
may be modified. Feel free to explain why something deserves to
be in the Hall of Fame when you submit PRs.

#### Structure

Add an entry to `_data/entries.yml` in the same format as the others.
Pretty straightforward, but feel free to raise any issues of this format
doesn't capture something you would like to submit!

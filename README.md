# Github Hall of Fame

Open source sometimes is awesome. Github does a good
job capturing that.

Submit epic issues, comments, commits, or pull requests!

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

The structure of this repo is one submission per file
so we don't have merge conflicts on every pull request.
A little harder to browser, a little easier to submit.

I'll make a website soon.
